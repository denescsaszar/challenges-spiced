/*
1. Header component
Task: Outsource the <header> into a Header component.

In the /src folder, create a subfolder called components. This is where all component files will live.
In /src/components, create a file called Header.js.
Export a Header component which returns the same <header></header> element as in the App.js file.
Don't forget the className attribute.
The function should receive a children prop and render it between the opening and closing <header> tags.
In the App.js file, import the Header component and replace the <header></header> tags with it.
🎉 Congratulations, you've created a wrapping Header component using the children prop!
